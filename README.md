# Clinical-Decision-Support-System
MIAPA 2017 symposium

A CDSS is an adaptation of the decision support system commonly used to support business management. Physicians, nurses and other
healthcare professionals use a CDSS to prepare a diagnosis and to review the diagnosis as a means of 
improving the final result. Such analysis can help predict potential events, which can range from drug interactions
to disease symptoms.

Here we modify present system by making it more user friendly as following:

- **Language friendly**: Now, we use making the system more language friendly as per the requirement of user.
 - **Large database**: Large database will not only provide us the increased access to the problem and 
 their solutions, but will also serve as the seed to artificial intelligence.
 - **App level**: Providing an applicationinterface to the user will give a new face to this entire medical science.
 - **Large involvement**: Large involvement at the doctor's as well as the patients part will enable us to cover 
 large number of problems as well as solution, as now on one problem any doctor can give his advice to the doctor who is handlibg
 that case .
 - **Security**: To make it more successful it mustbe more secured. For that, 
   
   - A patient can not directly link on it ,a doctor who is diagnosing him should be the medium of flow of information between the network of
  professionals and the individual.
